# Assistant
Contains the "brain" (assistant.py) and the "ears" and "mouth" (stt.py and tts.py). It also holds command_parser.py to link the two. In the future this would use some kind of natural language processing to give more flexible responses. For now we just store responses and things like the personality or name of the assistant in json
